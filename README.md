# Welcome to the Monday Morning Automation Guestbook!

This guestbook exists to help people learn how to create pull requests in Git.

You can get started with Git by following the Git video playlist in the [Monday Morning Automation YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGxoQvd-N916Nx7axNknPz5lYQLFERxcx)

To sign the guestbook:

1. Click the "Code" button on the repository, select "SSH", and click the copy icon

2. Open your command-line window and navigate to the folder where you'd like to clone the repository

3. Type "git clone" and then paste the link you copied from GitHub

4. cd to the repository

5. Create a branch and switch to it with the command "git checkout -b <yournamehere>signature" (replacing <yournamehere> with your name)

6. Open the guestbook.txt file and add a new line with your name, your location, and the date (leave one blank line after the previous guest)

7. Run "git add guestbook.txt" to stage the changes

8. Run "git commit -m "Signing the guestbook"" to commit the changes

9. Run "git push origin <yournamehere>signature" to push the changes to GitHub

10. Go to GitHub and click on the "1 commit ahead" link

11. Click the "Create pull request" button

12. Add a comment if you like, then click the "Create pull request" button again

13. Wait for me to approve and merge the pull request (this could take up to a week, depending on my schedule), then check out the Main branch in GitHub to see your addition to the guestbook!
