# Welcome to the Monday Morning Automation Guestbook!

This guestbook exists to help people learn how to create pull requests in Git.

You can get started with Git by following the Git video playlist in the [Monday Morning Automation YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGxoQvd-N916Nx7axNknPz5lYQLFERxcx)
